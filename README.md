# YogaGuru

*This project is a simple demonstration of using machine learning ability to produce the accuarcy of yoga practicener based on the body position he/she is performing with respect to the selected yoga pose*

### What all feature it provide:
- Easy setup and implementation
- Does not require high computational power (as it is based on mediapipe which is very efficient for computation)
- No internet require
- It gives real time accuarcy

### What all Things to improve :
-	A user can Upload a pre-recorded Video and get Feedback for the same.
-	Choose a tutorial video of your own choice and practice.
-	Increase the accuracy of the model.
-	Add different yoga poses/exercises.
